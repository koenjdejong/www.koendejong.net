      <description>I am busy studying. Of course, I am also working on some personal projects, but none of them are currently public.
Next to that, I am active in couple of Inter-Actief committees, such as the DipsomanIA, Symposium Committee and MedIA.
I am also a member of Hamers zonder Sikkel dispute, with whom I have a drink every Wednesday.</description>

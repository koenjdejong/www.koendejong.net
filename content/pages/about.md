I was born in a small city in the South-East of the Netherlands called Venray where I grew up playing field hockey and tennis. 
I was always interested in technology and computers, so I started out [Python Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to create simple drawings and games.
This led to creating some simple websites using HTML and CSS, which I hosted on my own Raspberry Pi.

After high school, I moved to Enschede to pursue my interests at a higher education level and started my bachelor in Computer Science at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/).
Next to my studies I became a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course Software Systems and Network Systems. 

After my bachelor, I continued my studies with a Master specializing in Cybersecurity. 
I also started working at [Innico](https://innico.nl) as a software engineer, where I help build the interface around a sales forcasting and stock planning web application.

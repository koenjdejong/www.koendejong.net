I am currently studying a MSc in computer science at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I am specializing in Cybersecurity. 
I am also working part-time as a software engineer at [Innico](https://innico.nl), where I help developing a sales forecasting and stock planning web application.

I am a big enthusiast on many different subjects, but focus mainly on new technologies and applying them to real-world problems, especially in cybersecurity, software architecture and sustainable practices.
On this website I will _occasionally_ [post](/posts/) about stuff that interests me and keep up to date on information about me.

I am currently studying computer science at the University of Twente, where I am specializing in Cybersecurity. 
I am also working as a software engineer at Innico.

I love learning about new technologies and applying them to real-world problems, especially in cybersecurity, software architecture and sustainable practices.
On this website I will _occasionally_ post about stuff that interests me and keep up to date on information about me.

In 2024, I (again) had the opportunity to organize the end-of-the-year festival for the community of the University of Twente, called [Summer Sounds](https://summersounds.nl/).
I was the Logistics & Crew manager in the committee, which meant I was responsible for the all materials, the permit and everything else regarding the logistical side of the festival, as well as the crew that helped us set up the festival.

The festival was originally organized by study association Inter-_Actief_, but in 2024 the financial responsibility was transferred a separate foundation.
Since I had already organized the event last year, Quirijn and I were asked to form the new committee and set up the new structure. 
We had a lot of freedom in how we wanted to set up the festival and decided that we would keep the festival free and open to everyone, which meant a larger location and bigger costs, but also a larger audience.

The festival took place on the 5th of July 2024, and was a huge success with over 1500 visitors, both students and staff.
The weather was not that great, but the atmosphere was amazing. 
Thanks to my entire committee, everything went smooth, and we made it a big success.

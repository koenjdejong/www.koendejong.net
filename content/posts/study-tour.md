Together with a group of thirty students and two professors, I started my journey to Australia and Japan with Study Tour Ascend, organized by Study Association [Inter-Actief](https://www.inter-actief.net/) from the University of Twente.
It is organized by fellow students with the support of the university to learn about the cultural differences and work ethics in the Computer Science field. 
The theme of the trip was "Interconnected Technologies" and we focused on the latest work they were doing in internet technology, data centres, cloud computing and their cybersecurity aspects.

Preparation for the trip began a couple of months in advance.  
We participated in preparatory sessions to learn about the destinations, set expectations, and create a bond with the group.

During the trip, we had the opportunity to explore the cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Tokyo and Osaka.
We visited several companies, universities and affiliated governmental organizations to learn how they are connected to the rest of the world.
I recorded all my experiences on [Polarsteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/koenjdejong/14013725-studiereis), where you can find all the places we visited and the activities we did.

After the trip, you were able to travel for a couple of weeks on your own.
I took this time to explore more from Japan and visited Vietnam with friends to cool down from the continuous visits, traveling and learning.
